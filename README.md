# Weka Output Parser

Converts Weka's output into an XML tree, which is much more computer-readable.

## Usage

In command line, simply type:

    java -jar WekaOutputParser.jar <source-file> <dest-file>

where `<source-file>` is a text file containing the weka output, and `<dest-file>` is the XML file to create.
